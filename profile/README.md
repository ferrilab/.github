# Ferrilab

This group manages `bitvec` and crates related to its development. It is
primarily just a distinction between @myrrlynâ€™s personal sketches and his
actually-popular crates.

If you have a crate that works closely with `bitvec` that you want to integrate
with us, you can ask us to adopt it; you can also ask to become a member of the
group if you want to help maintain any of the projects contained.

## Organization

Because `bitvec` depends closely on `funty` and `radium`, all three crates are
now stored in the `ferrilab/ferrilab` monorepo. The individual repositories for
all three crates are being sunset, and will be archived when we are satisfied
that we have made the transition (including user issues) reasonably well.
